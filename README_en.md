## Quick Start

### Workflow

Fork this project and initiate workflow updates, detailed steps are available
at [Detailed Tutorial](./docs/tutorial_en.md)

### Command Line

```shell
pip install pipenv
```

```shell
pipenv install --dev
```

Start update:

```shell
pipenv run dev
```

Start service:

```shell
pipenv run service
```

### GUI Software

1. Download [IPTV-API update software](https://github.com/Guovin/iptv-api/releases), open the software, click update to
   complete the update

2. Or run the following command in the project directory to open the GUI software:

```shell
pipenv run ui
```

### Docker

#### 1. Pull the image

```bash
docker pull guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

🚀 Proxy acceleration (recommended for users in China):

```bash
docker pull docker.1ms.run/guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

#### 2. Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 guovern/iptv-api
```

##### Mount(Recommended):

This allows synchronization of files between the host machine and the container. Modifying templates, configurations,
and retrieving updated result files can be directly operated in the host machine's folder.

Taking the host path /etc/docker as an example:

```bash
-v /etc/docker/config:/iptv-api/config
-v /etc/docker/output:/iptv-api/output
```

##### Environment Variables:

| Variable    | Description          | Default Value      |
|:------------|:---------------------|:-------------------|
| APP_HOST    | Service host address | "http://localhost" |
| APP_PORT    | Service port         | 8000               |
| UPDATE_CRON | Scheduled task time  | "0 22,10 * * *"    |

#### 3. Update Results

| Endpoint  | Description           |
|:----------|:----------------------|
| /         | Default endpoint      |
| /m3u      | m3u format endpoint   |
| /txt      | txt format endpoint   |
| /ipv4     | ipv4 default endpoint |
| /ipv6     | ipv6 default endpoint |
| /ipv4/txt | ipv4 txt endpoint     |
| /ipv6/txt | ipv6 txt endpoint     |
| /ipv4/m3u | ipv4 m3u endpoint     |
| /ipv6/m3u | ipv6 m3u endpoint     |
| /content  | Endpoint content      |
| /log      | Speed test log        |

- RTMP Streaming:

> [!NOTE]
> 1. To stream local video sources, create a `live` or `hls` (recommended) folder in the `config` directory.
> 2. The `live` folder is used for live streaming interfaces, and the `hls` folder is used for HLS streaming interfaces.
> 3. Place video files named after the `channel name` into these folders, and the program will automatically stream them
     to the corresponding channels.
> 4. Visit http://localhost:8080/stat to view real-time streaming status statistics.
